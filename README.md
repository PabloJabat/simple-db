# Simple DB

This is just a simple Database implementation to understand the different ways we can store data in Disk and RAM

## Set up

Install the requirements:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements
```

In order to make the database work you need to setup the env variable `SIMPLE_DB_PATH`.
